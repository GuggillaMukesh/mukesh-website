abstract: Hydrodynamic performance of the gliders having varying Wing sections (Flat plate and N0012 cross sections) and the comparison with the Nakamura’s (2013) Tsukuyomi model is focused in this paper. The simulations are performed in a commercial CFD software – STARCCM+ with k-ω turbulence model and the CFD model is validated using results from Nakamura et al., (2013). The drag and lift characteristics of these gliders are compared for different angles of attack for given velocity conditions and the results are shown.

abstract: In recent years, underwater technology is being developed for coastal survey and strategic applications. Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUVs) are a classic example of such technology. The Unmanned Underwater Gliders, unique among them, use a buoyancy propulsion mechanism to execute said operations with minimal or no acoustic noise without the need to disrupt the aquatic life. To increase the speed in the horizontal motion of such gliders, a new type of hull-form is being developed on the basis of the flying wing design called the Blended-winged Unmanned Underwater Gliders (BWUUGs). The increased lift-to-drag ratio due to the high lift generated by imitating the hull of the glider with a wing, results in lowering the glide angle, thereby increasing maneuvering efficiency. This paper gives the CFD results obtained from various hull-forms leading to the evolution of BWUUGs focusing on the wings of the glider by comparing the lift-to-drag ratios of classical hull-forms with that of the BWUUGs. The simulations are performed in a commercial CFD software – STARCCM+ with SST k-ω turbulence model validated using results from Nakamura et al., (2013).

abstract: Underwater Gliders, primarily being used for oceanographic data collection, are a unique set of hull-forms traversing the ocean without using a conventional propulsion mechanism. They instead depend on buoyancy coupled with mass actuators which result in special maneuvering characteristics. Thus, they perform distinctive attitudes of motion such as saw-tooth and spiral maneuvers for lateral and longitudinal plane movements respectively. This paper deals with the review of the Autonomous Underwater gliders (AUGs) over the course of time with respect to the design and maneuvering attitudes produced, the hydrodynamics of the hull-forms evolved for particular design applications. A preliminary analysis of the gliders , both legacy (i.e., Slocum (Webb et al., 2001), Spray (Sherman et al., 2001) and Seaglider (Eriksen et al., 2001)) and modern XRay, ZRay (D Spain et al., 2005), Deep glider (Osse and Eriksen, 2007) and Sea-Explorer (Claustre et al., 2014) is undertaken to arrive at a model that can be used for virtual station keeping (Jenkins et. al., 2003) termed as Virtual Mooring (Nakamura et. al., 2013).

abstract: Underwater Gliders are unique buoyancy propelled oceanographic profiling vehicles. Their speed and endurance in longitudinal motion are affected by the symmetry, sweep, dihedral angle and span of the control surfaces. In the low-velocity regime, these parameters can be varied to examine the flow around the glider. They also affect the lift-to-drag ratio (L/D) essential for the manoeuvring path in longitudinal and transverse motions. In this paper, the sweep angle of the main wing of a blended wing autonomous underwater glider configuration is varied as 10⁰, 15⁰, 30⁰, 45⁰ and 60⁰ and the resulting hull forms are numerically simulated in the commercial software, STARCCM+. The main wing is a tapered NACA0018 section (taken as per the general arrangement requirement) with 1.5m chord at the root and 0.1m at the tip. The numerical model is validated using the CFD results of NACA0012 airfoil from Sun.C et al., 2015 [1]. The hydrodynamic forces are obtained by varying the angle of attack (α) of the body from -15⁰ to 15⁰, for flow velocity of 0.4m/s. The hydrodynamic coefficients (lift-to-drag ratios) and flow physics around the wing are analyzed to arrive at an optimum Lift-to-drag ratio for increased endurance.
